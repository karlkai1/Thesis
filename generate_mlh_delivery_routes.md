Converts the optimized VRP solution (abstract routes with node sequences) into SUMO-compatible trip definitions that can be simulated with actual cargo bikes on the street network.

How It Works?

1. Configuration Loading:

Loads MLH depot coordinates from saved file
Ensures all routes will correctly start and end at the actual depot location

2. VRP Solution Import:

Loads the pickled VRP solution from the optimization step
Extracts all routes with their node sequences
Reports total bikes used, deliveries, and distance statistics
Validates the route structure

3. Coordinate Mapping:

Attempts to load delivery coordinates from the hybrid-snapped POI file (most accurate)
Falls back to CSV file if POI file unavailable
Creates a lookup dictionary mapping delivery IDs to their exact SUMO coordinates
This ensures stops occur at the correct snapped locations

4. Trip Generation:
For each optimized route:

Creates a SUMO <trip> element with cargo bike vehicle type
Sets departure time (starts at 6:00 AM, staggered by 5 minutes per bike)
Defines origin and destination both as MLH depot (round trip)
Critical: Uses fromXY and toXY attributes so SUMO's duarouter will calculate the actual path

5. Stop Creation:
For each delivery point in the route (excluding depot at start/end):

Adds a <stop> element at the exact delivery coordinates
Sets 180-second (3 minutes) delivery duration
Enables parking (cargo bikes can park anywhere)
Skips any nodes without valid coordinates

6. Route Validation:

Verifies each route starts and ends with 'mlh'
Counts successful routes (with valid stops) vs. failed routes (no valid stops)
Flags routes with coordinate lookup issues

7. Departure Scheduling:

First bike: 6:00 AM (21600 seconds)
Subsequent bikes: Staggered by 5 minutes (300 seconds) each
Prevents traffic congestion at depot
Spreads out the fleet deployment

8. Output File Creation:
Saves XML file (mlh_vrp_trips_BIKE.xml) containing:

All trip definitions
Embedded stop sequences
Metadata comment with summary statistics

9. Next Step Instructions:
Provides the exact duarouter command needed to:

Convert abstract trips into concrete routes through the street network
Use the extreme bike-preferred network
Include cargo bike vehicle type definitions
Handle any routing errors gracefully

Purpose in the Thesis
This script is the bridge between optimization and simulation. It transforms:
From: Abstract mathematical solution

"Bike 5 should visit nodes: mlh → 142 → 389 → 551 → mlh"

To: Executable SUMO simulation

"Cargo bike 5 departs MLH at 6:25 AM, travels via actual streets to delivery 142 (stop 3 min), then delivery 389 (stop 3 min), then delivery 551 (stop 3 min), returns to MLH"

Key features specific to cargo bikes:
Short delivery duration: 3 minutes (vs. 5 for vans) - bikes are more agile for parking/unloading
Staggered departures: 5-minute intervals prevent depot congestion with many bikes
Round-trip structure: All bikes return to MLH (not like vans that might end at different depots)
Parking flexibility: Bikes can stop anywhere (parking="true")
Network compatibility: Will be routed through the extreme bike-preferred network, maximizing use of cycling infrastructure
What Happens Next
After running duarouter (the command provided by the script):

SUMO calculates actual paths through the street network for each trip
Respects bike lane preferences from the extreme network
Generates turn-by-turn routing through intersections
Creates the final route file (mlh_vrp_final_BIKE.rou.xml) ready for full traffic simulation

Traffic interactions
Actual travel times
Real stop sequences
Network-constrained routing

The output can then be compared against the van-based Status Quo to evaluate performance differences in the SUMO simulation environment.
