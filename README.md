Generates a comprehensive trip matrix containing all possible routes between a Micro Logistics Hub (MLH) depot and delivery points, specifically configured for cargo bike operations. This is the preparatory step before route calculation and distance matrix extraction.

How It Works?

1. Configuration and Setup:

Loads MLH depot coordinates from a saved file
Falls back to default coordinates if the file doesn't exist
Sets delivery stop duration to 180 seconds (3 minutes) - shorter than traditional vans (5 minutes) because cargo bikes are more agile

2. Loading Delivery Points:

Reads the hybrid-snapped delivery points from snapped_delivery_points_HYBRID.poi.xml
Extracts numeric IDs and coordinates from each POI
Filters out duplicate coordinates to avoid redundant routing calculations
Reports how many unique delivery locations exist

3. Trip Matrix Structure:
Calculates three categories of trips:

MLH → Delivery: Routes from the hub to each delivery point (N trips)
Delivery → Delivery: Routes between all pairs of delivery points (N × (N-1) trips, excluding self-loops)
Delivery → MLH: Return routes from each delivery point back to the hub (N trips)

Total trips = N + N×(N-1) + N = N² trips (where N = number of delivery points)
4. Trip Generation - Three Types:
Type 1: MLH → Delivery trips

Vehicle starts at MLH depot
Travels to a delivery point
Includes a stop element with 180-second parking duration
Uses cargo bike vehicle type

Type 2: Delivery → Delivery trips

Routes between every pair of delivery points
Excludes self-loops (no point to itself)
Each trip includes a stop at the destination
Represents potential transitions within a delivery tour

Type 3: Delivery → MLH return trips

Routes from each delivery point back to MLH
No stop element needed (trip ends at depot)
Critical for ensuring round-trip feasibility

5. XML Output Structure:
Creates a SUMO-compatible trip file with:

Trip definitions using fromXY/toXY coordinates
Cargo bike vehicle type specification
Stop elements with parking permissions
Metadata comments documenting the configuration

6. Summary and Next Steps:
Reports statistics and provides the exact command to run SUMO's duarouter tool, which will:

Calculate actual routes through the street network
Account for bike lane availability
Generate travel distances and times
Handle the extreme bike-preferred network settings

Purpose in the Thesis
This script is the bridge between location data and routing calculations. It:
-Prepares input for SUMO routing engine: Creates every possible trip combination that a VRP solver might need to evaluate
-Cargo bike specific features:

Uses bike-friendly vehicle types
Shorter stop times (bikes are faster to park/unpark)
Can access bike lanes and paths unavailable to cars
Single centralized depot (not separate warehouse entry/exit)

Enables distance matrix creation: By pre-generating all possible trips, SUMO can calculate all distances in one batch operation, which is then extracted by the distance matrix script from earlier.
Key difference from Status Quo: This represents the MLH cargo bike scenario, whereas the original system likely used delivery vans from a peripheral warehouse. The trip matrix structure is similar, but the vehicle type, depot location, and network characteristics are optimized for urban cargo bike operations.
The output of this script becomes the input for SUMO's duarouter, which does the actual pathfinding and distance calculation using the bike-preferred network.
