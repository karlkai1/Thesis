Overview
This script generates a complete trip matrix for vehicle routing problem (VRP) optimization, creating all possible trips between delivery points and a central depot with separate exit and return coordinates.
What It Does

Loads Delivery Points:

Reads snapped POI coordinates from snapped_delivery_points_dedup.poi.xml
Filters out any duplicate coordinates (rounded to 2 decimal places)


Defines Depot Locations:

Exit depot: (3042.08, 5102.54) - Where vehicles start their routes
Return depot: (3054.28, 5105.04) - Where vehicles end their routes
Separate coordinates allow for realistic depot entry/exit routing


Generates Comprehensive Trip Matrix:
A. Depot → Delivery Trips (depot_to_{id}):

From exit depot to each delivery point
Includes 5-minute (300 second) stop at delivery location

B. Delivery → Delivery Trips (del_{from}_to_{to}):

Between all pairs of delivery points (excluding self-loops)
Each includes 5-minute stop at destination
Total: N × (N-1) trips where N = number of delivery points

C. Delivery → Depot Trips (return_{id}_to_depot):

From each delivery point back to return depot
No stop needed (end of route)

D. Depot Test Trip (depot_exit_to_return_test):

Direct route from exit to return depot
Validates depot-to-depot routing


Trip Attributes:

fromXY/toXY: Exact coordinates for routing
type: Set to "delivery" for all trips
depart: "0.00" (placeholder; actual times set during optimization)
stops: Include exact coordinates, duration, and parking flag


Outputs XML File:

Creates trip_matrix_dedup_with_returns.xml
SUMO-compatible route file format
Pretty-printed with progress tracking



Input Requirements

snapped_delivery_points_dedup.poi.xml - Road-snapped delivery coordinates

Must contain <poi> elements with id, x, y attributes


Output

trip_matrix_dedup_with_returns.xml - Complete trip matrix for routing
Console output with:

Progress updates during generation
Summary statistics
Next steps for route calculation



Key Parameters

Delivery stop duration: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
Exit depot: (3042.08, 5102.54)
Return depot: (3054.28, 5105.04)

Trip Matrix Size
For N delivery points:

Depot → Delivery: N trips
Delivery → Delivery: N × (N-1) trips
Delivery → Depot: N trips
Test trip: 1 trip
Total: 2N + N² - N + 1 = N² + N + 1 trips
