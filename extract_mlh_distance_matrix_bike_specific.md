Extracts and processes routing data from SUMO simulations to create a distance matrix specifically for cargo bike deliveries operating from a Micro Logistics Hub (MLH). This matrix is then used for Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) optimization.

How It Works?

1. Data Loading:

Reads pre-calculated bike routes from a SUMO route file (mlh_trip_matrix_routes_bike.rou.xml)
Loads the network to calculate accurate distances
These routes were previously generated by SUMO's routing engine using bike-specific constraints

2. Route Analysis and Distance Extraction:
Processes three types of routes:

MLH → Delivery points: Routes from the hub to each delivery location
Delivery → MLH: Return routes back to the hub
Delivery → Delivery: Direct routes between delivery points

For each route, it calculates the total distance by either:

Using pre-calculated route length from the XML attribute
Summing up individual edge lengths from the network

3. Accessibility Analysis:
Identifies which delivery points have bidirectional connectivity:

Can be reached from MLH
Can return to MLH
Flags problematic "one-way" points that might have routing issues

Only fully bidirectional points are included in the final matrix to ensure valid round trips.
4. Distance Matrix Construction:
Creates an NxN matrix where:

Rows and columns represent locations (MLH depot + delivery points)
Each cell contains the bike routing distance between two locations
Diagonal is zero (no distance to travel to yourself)
Missing/impossible routes are marked as infinity

5. Quality Checks:
Calculates and reports:

Matrix density (percentage of routes successfully calculated)
MLH connectivity (can it reach all points and vice versa?)
Distance statistics (average, median, maximum distances)
Routes exceeding 3km and 5km thresholds

6. Output Generation:
Saves three formats:

.npy file: NumPy binary format for fast loading in VRP optimization
.txt file: List of node IDs (MLH + delivery point IDs)
.csv file: Human-readable matrix for inspection and validation

7. Comparative Analysis:
Compares the MLH bike scenario against a "Status Quo" baseline:

Shows if cargo bikes can reach more or fewer delivery points
Provides insights on whether the MLH location improves accessibility

8. Operational Insights:
Evaluates MLH location quality based on average distances:

Excellent: < 2km average
Good: 2-3km average
Concerning: > 3km average

Purpose in the Paper:
This script bridges the gap between SUMO traffic simulation and VRP optimization algorithms. It transforms raw routing data into a standardized distance matrix that can be fed into optimization solvers to:

Plan optimal cargo bike delivery routes
Evaluate different MLH locations
Compare bike-based delivery performance against traditional vehicle-based delivery
Ensure all planned routes are physically feasible in the real street network

The bike-specific aspect means it respects cycling infrastructure, speed limits, and accessibility constraints rather than using straight-line distances or car-based routing.
