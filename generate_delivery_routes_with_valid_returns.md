Overview
This script converts optimized VRP solution routes into SUMO vehicle trip definitions with dynamic routing, creating realistic delivery van schedules with multiple stops per vehicle.
What It Does

Loads VRP Solution:

Reads optimized routes from vrp_solution_split.pkl
Extracts vehicle routes and node sequences
Retrieves delivery counts and route metadata


Analyzes Route Structure:

Displays complete analysis of all van routes
Shows route lengths and delivery sequences for each vehicle
Validates that routes start and end at depot


Loads Delivery Coordinates:

Reads snapped POI coordinates from snapped_delivery_points_dedup.poi.xml
Creates lookup map: delivery point ID → (x, y) coordinates
Reports any missing coordinate data


Generates SUMO Trip Definitions:
Creates XML structure with:

Vehicle type definition (delivery_van):

Class: delivery
Dimensions: 7.5m × 2.5m
Max speed: 13.89 m/s (≈50 km/h)
Color: Red (255,0,0)
Acceleration/deceleration parameters


Trip elements for each van:

Unique ID: delivery_van_{number}
Start location: Exit depot coordinates
End location: Return depot coordinates
Departure time: Staggered (10-minute intervals starting at 5 AM)




Adds Dynamic Stop Sequences:

For each delivery point in the route, adds <stop> element with:

Exact coordinates from snapped POI file
Duration: 300 seconds (5 minutes) per delivery
Parking: true (vehicle stops completely)


SUMO dynamically routes between stops at runtime


Validates Route Quality:

Checks for depot start/end compliance
Identifies missing coordinate mappings
Reports successful vs. failed route generation
Compares planned deliveries to actual stops generated


Staggers Departure Times:

Start time: 18000 seconds (5:00 AM)
Interval: 600 seconds (10 minutes) between vans
Prevents traffic congestion at depot exit
Creates realistic fleet dispatch pattern


Input Requirements

vrp_solution_split.pkl - Optimized VRP solution with split routes
snapped_delivery_points_dedup.poi.xml - Road-snapped delivery coordinates

Output

status_quo_delivery_dynamic.rou.xml - SUMO trip file with dynamic routing

Key Parameters

Depot exit: (3042.08, 5102.54)
Depot return: (3054.28, 5105.04)
Stop duration: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
Start time: 18000 seconds (5:00 AM)
Departure interval: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
Vehicle specs:

Length: 7.5m
Width: 2.5m
Max speed: 13.89 m/s

Route Generation Logic
For each optimized van route:

Extract delivery sequence (excluding depot nodes)
Look up coordinates for each stop
Create trip from exit depot to return depot
Insert stop elements for each delivery in sequence
Assign staggered departure time

Dynamic vs. Static Routing
Dynamic routing (this script):

Provides only stop coordinates
SUMO calculates routes at runtime
Adapts to traffic conditions
More flexible but requires more computation

Static routing (alternative):

Pre-calculates complete routes with duarouter
Fixed edge sequences
Faster simulation but less adaptive

Statistics Reported

Total routes loaded from VRP solution
Total planned deliveries
Route analysis for each van (length and sequence)
Successful vs. failed route generation
Missing coordinate warnings
Average deliveries per van


Next Step Command
The script outputs the exact duarouter command needed:
bashduarouter -n MUNET.net.xml --route-files status_quo_delivery_dynamic.rou.xml \
  --additional-files vehicle_types.add.xml \
  -o status_quo_final_dynamic.rou.xml \
  --ignore-errors --repair --remove-loops --routing-threads 8
duarouter flags:

--ignore-errors: Continue despite routing issues
--repair: Fix broken routes automatically
--remove-loops: Eliminate circular paths
--routing-threads 8: Parallel processing

Dependencies

pickle - Load VRP solution
lxml - XML generation
pandas - (imported but not actively used)

Error Handling

Validates depot start/end for all routes
Reports missing coordinates by delivery ID
Skips empty routes (depot-only)
Tracks and reports failed route generation

Workflow Position
This is the final step in the delivery route planning pipeline:

1 Convert coordinates (UTM → SUMO)
2 Remove duplicates
3 Snap to road network
4 Generate trip matrix
5 Run duarouter to calculate distances to from all points to all points
6 Calculate distance matrix
7 Solve VRP with route splitting
8 Generate SUMO trip files (this script)
9 Run duarouter to create final routes
10 Run SUMO simulation without background traffic to test (if needed)

Note
The "status_quo" prefix indicates this represents the baseline delivery scenario before any optimizations or changes to the delivery system. With parameter optimizations throughout the same pipeline, one can obtain different scenarios. Either through step 7 (solving VRP) or through step 10 (generating routes).
