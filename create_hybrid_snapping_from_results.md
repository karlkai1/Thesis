Creates a hybrid snapping strategy that combines bike-lane-preferred snapping with fallback to road snapping for problematic delivery points. This solves connectivity issues discovered after initial bike-lane-only snapping.

How It Works?

1. Problem Identification:

Loads the original delivery points dataset (936 total points)
Reads the list of successfully routed bidirectional points from the bike scenario (908 points)
Identifies the 28 problematic points that couldn't achieve bidirectional connectivity when snapped to bike lanes
These are points where bike-lane snapping caused routing failures (either unreachable from MLH or can't return to MLH)

2. Loading Two Snapping Versions:

Original snapping: Points snapped to regular roads (guaranteed connectivity)
Bike-preferred snapping: Points snapped to bike lanes (better for cycling but some connectivity issues)
Creates a lookup table of original positions for the problematic points

3. Hybrid Strategy Construction:
For each delivery point:

If it's one of the 28 problematic points: Revert to the original road-based snapping position (marked orange)
If it's one of the 908 successful points: Keep the bike-lane snapping position (marked green)

4. Visual Color Coding:

Green (0,255,0): Points successfully snapped to bike lanes (908 points)
Orange (255,165,0): Points reverted to road snapping due to connectivity issues (28 points)
Red (255,0,0): Fallback color if something goes wrong

5. Output Generation:

Saves the hybrid snapping file: snapped_delivery_points_HYBRID.poi.xml
Documents which specific points had problems in: problematic_bike_points.txt
Provides statistics on how many points use each snapping strategy

6. Next Steps Guidance:
Tells you to:

Regenerate the trip matrix using the hybrid snapping
Re-run the routing with this corrected snapping
Verify that all 936 points now have bidirectional connectivity

Purpose in the Thesis
This is a problem-solving script that emerged after discovering that pure bike-lane snapping caused routing failures for some delivery points. It represents a pragmatic compromise:

Maximizes bike infrastructure usage
Ensures complete connectivity 
Documents the trade-offs

This hybrid approach is more realistic than the extreme bike-only scenario, as it acknowledges that some delivery locations simply aren't accessible via bike infrastructure alone and require mixed-mode routing (bike lanes + regular roads).
