Generates a comprehensive trip matrix containing all possible routes between a Micro Logistics Hub (MLH) depot and delivery points, specifically configured for cargo bike operations. This is the preparatory step before route calculation and distance matrix extraction.

How It Works?

1. Configuration and Setup:

Loads MLH depot coordinates from a saved file (mlh_depot_coords.txt)
Falls back to default coordinates (2000, 2535) if the file doesn't exist
Sets delivery stop duration to 180 seconds (3 minutes) - shorter than traditional vans (5 minutes) because cargo bikes are more agile

2. Loading Delivery Points:

Reads bike-preferred snapped delivery points from snapped_delivery_points_bike_preferred.poi.xml
Extracts numeric IDs from POI names (e.g., "dp_142" becomes 142)
Extracts coordinates for each delivery location

3. Duplicate Filtering:

Rounds coordinates to 2 decimal places
Removes duplicate delivery locations at the same coordinates
Ensures each unique location is only processed once
Reports how many POIs were filtered vs. retained

4. Trip Matrix Structure:
Calculates three categories of trips:

MLH → Delivery: Routes from the hub to each delivery point (N trips)
Delivery → Delivery: Routes between all pairs of delivery points (N × (N-1) trips, excluding self-loops)
Delivery → MLH: Return routes from each delivery point back to the hub (N trips)

Total trips = N + N×(N-1) + N = N² trips (where N = number of delivery points)
5. Trip Generation - Three Types:
Type 1: MLH → Delivery trips

Vehicle starts at MLH depot coordinates
Travels to a delivery point coordinate
Includes a stop element with 180-second parking duration
Uses "cargo_bike" vehicle type
Allows parking anywhere (cargo bikes are flexible)

Type 2: Delivery → Delivery trips

Routes between every pair of delivery points
Excludes self-loops (no point travels to itself)
Each trip includes a stop at the destination with 180s duration
Represents potential transitions within a delivery tour
Shows progress every 10% to track generation

Type 3: Delivery → MLH return trips

Routes from each delivery point back to MLH depot
No stop element needed (trip ends at depot)
Critical for ensuring round-trip feasibility

6. XML Output Structure:
Creates a SUMO-compatible trip file (mlh_trip_matrix.xml) with:

Trip definitions using fromXY/toXY coordinates
Cargo bike vehicle type specification
Stop elements with parking permissions
Metadata comments documenting the configuration

7. Summary Statistics:
Reports:

Total trips created in each category
MLH depot location used
Stop duration setting
Time elapsed for generation

8. Next Steps Guidance:
Provides the exact duarouter command to:

Calculate actual routes through the street network
Use the extreme bike-preferred network (MUNET_EXTREME_bike.net.xml)
Generate travel distances and times
Handle routing errors gracefully

Purpose in the  Thesis
This script is the bridge between location data and routing calculations. It prepares all possible trip combinations that might be needed for VRP optimization:
Why generate ALL possible trips?

The VRP solver needs to know the distance between ANY two points to optimize routes
By generating all combinations upfront, SUMO can batch-calculate all distances in one run
This creates the complete distance matrix needed for optimization

Cargo bike specific features:

Uses "cargo_bike" vehicle type (will follow bike-specific routing rules)
Shorter stop times (3 min vs 5 min for vans) - bikes park/unload faster
Single centralized MLH depot (not separate warehouse entry/exit like traditional logistics)
Can park anywhere (parking="true") - bikes don't need formal parking spaces

Key difference from Status Quo:
This represents the MLH cargo bike scenario, whereas the original system likely used delivery vans from a peripheral warehouse. The trip matrix structure is similar, but optimized for urban cargo bike operations with central depot location and bike-friendly infrastructure.
The output of this script becomes the input for SUMO's duarouter, which does the actual pathfinding through the bike-preferred street network you created earlier, generating the distances needed for VRP optimization.
