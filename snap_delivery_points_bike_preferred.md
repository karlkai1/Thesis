This script is called **"Snap Delivery Points to Bike-Preferred Locations"** and here's what it does:

## Main Purpose
The script re-snaps delivery point locations, with a **preference for bike lanes** over regular roads. It's comparing a new bike-friendly snapping strategy against the original snapping.

## Key Functionality

**1. Input Loading:**
- Reads a SUMO network file (`MUNET.net.xml`)
- Loads delivery point coordinates from a CSV (`output_dedup_reindexed.csv`)
- Loads previously snapped points from an XML file for comparison

**2. Smart Snapping Logic:**
For each delivery point, it:
- Searches within a 50m radius for nearby lanes
- **Prioritizes bike lanes** (cycleways/paths) if they're within 30m walking distance
- If no suitable bike lane exists, it keeps the original snapping position
- Falls back to regular lanes only if necessary

**3. Visual Differentiation:**
- Green POIs = snapped to bike lanes
- Red POIs = kept on regular roads/original position

**4. Comparison Visualization:**
Creates a separate file showing:
- **White points** = original locations
- **Green/Red points** = new locations
- **Yellow lines** = movement vectors showing how far points were relocated

**5. Statistics Output:**
Reports:
- How many points were snapped to bike lanes vs. kept original
- Percentage using bike infrastructure
- The 5 largest movements to bike lanes
